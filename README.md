## 🛫 Learn More
The Frontend of this application was created using the Next.js typescript template and tailwind CSS. The Backend was developed using Sanity. Several libraries were used to facilitate some of the developer processes such as Framer-Motion for animations. 
This Application was deployed with Vercel. Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# 👨‍💻 For Dev:
```bash
npm run dev
```
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed locally on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
